                Quarantine Assist is a web application connecting individuals who are in quarantine and need assistance with local volunteers. <br />
                People in self-quarantine can create tasks describing what they need help with (ex. grocery shopping, prescription pickup, pet care, etc.)
                and volunteers in their community can help them by picking up the tasks. <br /> <br />
                Create an account to create your first <b><a href="/task/new">task</a></b> or volunteer for <b><a href="tasks/all">tasks</a></b>.
